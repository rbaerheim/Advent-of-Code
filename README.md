My solutions to the Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a fun way to both learn how to deal with various problems, and learning to solve problems in new ways.

All of the tasks I do is done in Python3, but as i further develop my skills I will also be adding ways of solving them in other coding languages.

I do not expect to solve the problems in the most efficient way possible but I enjoy learning and will maybe check back after a while to improve the solutions.
