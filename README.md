# Advent of Code
My solutions to the Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a fun way to learn to deal with various problems, and learning to solve problems in new ways.

The tasks are done in various programming languages. I do them in languages I prefer to learn more about.

I do not expect to solve the problems in the most efficient way possible but I enjoy learning and plan to check back from time to time to improve my solutions.

The tasks are my own work. I do however get hints online if I get stuck for more than 30 minutes. 
I do not copy snippets from online, I read about how to solve the problem and then implement it into my own code.
I look at documentation before stack overflow.

Also, I prefer the learning aspect of AoC rather than the competition.
I write good, effective and scalable code slow, rather than bad code fast.
